The application capitalizes on market inneficiencies by identifying highly correlated securities and performing a pairs trade.

With this assumption, the strategy is to go long on the undervalued security and short on the overvalued security. We expect this to be profitable when the two securities' values to eventually normalize due to the mean reversion principle.
